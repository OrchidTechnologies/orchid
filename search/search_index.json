A major design goal of the layer 2 is to make it possible to send the absolute smallest payments theoretically possible. Users can move funds from any layer 1 blockchain that has the Lottery contract successfully deployed onto the Orchid layer 2 using Orchid's dapp . Moving funds into and out of an Orchid account is similar to a layer 2 bridge - users move funds from their attached wallet into a smart contract that governs the rules of the layer 2 and can move funds back out to their attached wallet. Unlike many other layer 2 solutions, Orchid utilizes two sets of keys to manage a single Orchid account. There is the funder wallet, which is the layer 1 wallet that attaches to the dapp to move funds into the account and the Orchid L2 keys, which is a second keypair that can be used to spend funds from the L2 account. The Orchid dapp asks for the \"Orchid Identity\" which is in reference to the L2 keys. As of now, the L2 keys can be generated in the Orchid app or could be generated by hand. Many blockchains that Orchid is running on today do not properly support the methods needed to scan for accounts. That means that to specify and use an Orchid account, both the L1 address (the funder wallet address) and the L2 address (the \"Orchid Identity\") must be specified along with the L1 blockchain in order to find the account. The Orchid Lottery contract is deployed as a singleton at this address: 0x6db8381b2b41b74e17f5d4eb82e8d5b04dda0a82 How to get an Orchid account Purchase an account (iOS/macOS/Android only feature) funded by Orchid Create L2 keys in the app and fund your own Orchid account using the Orchid dApp Have an account L2 key shared with you (depending on the blockchain, you may also need the funder wallet address) A Note on Purchased Orchid accounts (iOS/macOS/Android) In the Orchid Android, iOS and macOS apps, it is possible to simply purchase an Orchid account from Orchid Labs with prepaid access credits using an in-app purchase. These are distinct from Orchid accounts created in the dApp and have the following properties: Purchased accounts connect only to preferred providers for VPN service. It is not possible to transfer the crypto out of a purchased Orchid account in the same way as an account created in the dApp. Accounts are created on the Gnosis blockchain and are denominated in the xDAI stablecoin. Orchid takes your in-app purchase funds and adds the equivalent xDAI to the selected Orchid address on the xDAI blockchain. Your balance and deposit will increase by the amount of USD purchased. Orchid account efficiency Orchid\u2019s nanopayments work on a simple principle: instead of giving your provider $1 one hundred times, it\u2019s better for you to give them 100 scratch-off tickets with a 1% chance of winning $100. That way, even though the provider still receives $100 on average, you only pay for one transaction, instead of one hundred. The transmitted value is determined by comparing the amount of the total ticket value to the value lost to transaction fees; if your ticket was worth $100 and the L1 network fees to process the transaction cost $10, your ticket has a 90% efficiency to the provider. When the efficiency of an account drops below 0%, providers will no longer accept payments from that account, because the network fees are greater than the amount of value they could receive from a winning ticket. There are two major factors that affect efficiency: The size of the deposit, which determines the face value of the tickets The network fees for the L1 blockchain that houses the account at a given moment Efficiency example Imagine an Orchid account with a 10 xDAI deposit. The account will issue tickets with a maximum 5 xDAI face value; therefore, providers get a tiny chance at \u201cwinning\u201d a maximum 5xDAI with each ticket they accept for service. Providers must pay the network fee to claim the 5 xDAI; so, the provider queries the current L1 network fee and makes sure the fee is not greater than 5 xDAI. When the network fees the provider pays to claim the fees are greater than 5 xDAI ticket value, the provider does not accept payments from that account, as that account has a <0% efficiency. Typically you want the face value to be 20X the network fee, which would roughly result in 5% L1 fees being paid or 95% efficiency. Deposit The deposit is required to accept service and is verified by providers. The deposit prevents double spending, and in general, the deposit maintains good standing on the network. The size of the deposit determines the maximum face value of the tickets sent from the user to the provider. The face value refers to the amount of funds that a provider claims when they receive a winning ticket; currently, the face value is set to half the value of the deposit. When an Orchid account is funded, the deposit is \u201clocked\u201d and cannot be withdrawn from the account until it is \u201cunlocked\u201d and the requisite 24-hour cool-off period has passed. Size of deposit Market conditions are constantly changing, which includes fluctuations in network fees. When the account efficiency gets low, it is a good idea to add additional funds to your deposit to increase the efficiency. We recommend a minimum deposit that sets your ticket value to 90% efficiency; consult our chart for more information on recommended deposit amounts. Balance The balance of the Orchid account is the amount of currency held to pay providers. When the account is in use, the tickets are backed by funds in the balance. When a ticket \u201cwins\u201d, the face value of the ticket is withdrawn from the user\u2019s account balance and deposited into the provider\u2019s account with an on-chain transaction. The Lottery contract governs this behavior. As a practical matter, a user's balance will remain unchanged for long periods of time; this is because you can sometimes receive significant amounts of service before a payment ticket \u201cwins\u201d, funds are claimed, and your balance is adjusted. It is useful to think of Orchid account balances as a number of maximum sized tickets. So if the account\u2019s deposit size is 10 xDAI, and there is 15 xDAI in the balance, because the size of each ticket is 5 xDAI (deposit / 2) there are 3 tickets worth of balance (total balance / ticket size). The dApp has an Add Funds screen to add additional balance to your account. Tickets A ticket is a nanopayment sent from a user to a provider to pay for service. The ticket has a probability of winning along with a face value, which is the amount of currency the provider receives if the ticket \u201cwins\u201d. The face value of a ticket is set at half of the deposit in the Orchid account. While this is hard coded in the app right now, in the future the face value of tickets could vary, depending on market conditions and to optimize for variance. However, the upper limit of ticket size is governed by the deposit, and the max ticket size is always half of the deposit. Orchid accounts with very few tickets will experience a high amount of variance due to the nature of probability. Variance There is an important concept to consider when using Orchid: variance . Since tickets have a probability of a win, it is possible that a winning ticket will be claimed either faster or slower than is expected. For a quick example, imagine you have an Orchid account with one ticket worth of balance. As you start using the service, you get \u201cunlucky\u201d, and a winning ticket is issued immediately; your balance then goes to zero, and you will need to add funds. This is an example of not getting what you expect due to variance. The inverse can also happen: that is, you may receive much more service than expected because your winning ticket is not getting pulled. To combat variance, Orchid accounts need more tickets worth of service. That way, the probability of a winning ticket being issued before or after you would expect is mitigated. As of now, Orchid recommends at least four tickets worth of service in your account balance. Technical parts of an Orchid account The makeup of an Orchid account is important for understanding how to manage it, and how the different components work together. Ultimately, the technical details of the account are dictated by the nanopayment smart contract, which holds the funds and allows users to interact with their accounts. The Orchid funder wallet The funder wallet is a blockchain address that corresponds to the wallet address that funded the account. The owner of that wallet has complete control over the Orchid account and can add or remove funds, along with all the other operations available in the Orchid account manager. Simply put, the funder wallet is the custodian of the Orchid account. Without the keys to the funder wallet, no functions can be performed on the account, such as adding/removing funds, unlocking/locking the deposit and moving funds between balance and deposit. If the keys to a funder wallet are lost, the associated Orchid account will still function, but the user cannot add funds, remove funds or make any changes to the account. You will be able to use the account while it\u2019s efficiency is above 0%, until the balance is reduced to zero. If the deposit is lost, and the account efficiency drops below 0%, there is no way to add to the deposit. The Orchid address and key An Orchid account utilizes its own keypair besides the layer 1 funder wallet address: the layer 2 \"Orchid identity\" keypair. The public portion of the keypair is the address used when funding the Orchid account. In the Orchid dApp, the address is required before an Orchid account can be funded; you can copy your Orchid identity in the app, and paste that in the Orchid identity field in the dApp to create an account. The private portion of the key or \u201csecret\u201d is used by the client to sign tickets. The key is therefore a core technical property of the Orchid account; it is the important bit of information that is shared when an Orchid account is shared between people or devices. The keypair is generated in the app. To create a new keypair, go to \u201cManage Accounts\u201d, tap on the cog wheel, and select \u201cNew Identity\u201d. The Orchid address will be displayed next to an identicon and can be copied over to the dApp to add an Orchid account to this address. Then, you can export the key by selecting \u201cExport Identity\u201d and have access to any accounts with that address. A keypair can also be manually generated and used with Orchid. Sharing Orchid accounts There\u2019s no limit to the number of people or devices that a single Orchid account can be shared with. The account is specified by the L1 funder wallet address, the L2 identity key, and the chain the account is funded on. To share an account, go to \u201cManage Accounts\u201d, tap on the cog wheel, and select \u201cExport Identity\u201d. A QR code encoding this information will appear, as well as a Copy button. The account information is displayed under the QR code, and can be copied and directly pasted into the client app as text. Also note the L1 chain the account was funded upon; as Orchid has expanded to multiple partnerships with chains, the functionality to automatically determine the originating chain for each wallet has encountered difficulties. So, to share accounts, it is important to select the correct chain to properly access the Orchid account. Orchid Account Troubleshooting Deposit size too small Both the Orchid client app and the Orchid web dApp will display a warning when the Orchid account efficiency or balance is too low for usage. There are a few solutions when you see this error: For in-app purchased accounts (Android/iOS/macOS only feature): Tap on the warning to go into the selected account. Simply use \u201cAdd Credit\u201d to increase the balance and deposit with an in-app purchase. Do not try to fix purchased accounts in the dApp; only manage purchased accounts using in-app purchases. For Orchid accounts created with the dApp: The Orchid dApp can add funds to the account\u2019s deposit, which will improve the Orchid account efficiency and eliminate the warning, allowing the app to start working. To add funds, connect the funder wallet used to create the Orchid account and click on the \u201cAdd Funds\u201d tab. What is the difference between Balance and Deposit in my Orchid Account? The balance is the collateral for the tickets sent from the user to the provider. Over time, as winning tickets are issued from your Orchid app, the Orchid account balance will decrease. The deposit is the Orchid token held in escrow; this amount never depletes and can be withdrawn after the 24-hour \"unlock\" period.","title":"Orchid Accounts"},{"location":"accounts/#how-orchids-layer-2-works","text":"","title":"How Orchid\u2019s Layer 2 Works"},{"location":"accounts/#accounts","text":"Orchid accounts are the center of Orchid\u2019s \"probabilistic rollup\" layer 2, which enables a stream of tiny payments to be sent from the account owner to a provider for services.

Basic Internet connections function by transmitting packets of data between two hosts (computers). In order to find their way, packets contain both a source and destination IP address. As packets move from the destination to the source, different routers and physical infrastructure require both of these addresses for the two-way connection to be established and maintained. This means that instantly and over time, the owners of the physical infrastructure are in a position to build a profile of Internet usage on their paying user (you!) and also to block content as the owner sees fit. Typically these infrastructure owners are ISPs \u2014 mobile carriers providing phone data connections, home cable Internet providers, WiFi hotspot operators, and any Internet backbone operators that have peering agreements with user-facing ISPs. In all these cases, the ISP is in an advantaged position to monitor and/or restrict Internet usage. It is common in many countries for ISPs to restrict content so that users cannot load certain websites. If you are not happy with or do not trust your existing ISP(s), by using Orchid you can currently limit their knowledge to knowing only that you are sending and receiving bytes through Orchid, and completely block their ability to mess with the details of your traffic, unblocking the previously blocked content. They either block all of Orchid or nothing, so if things continue to work after turning on Orchid, then your ISP has allowed \"Orchid in general\" and cannot manipulate the individual bytes between you and the rest of the Internet, granting you access to the entire Internet. How can the Orchid app help me with privacy today? The goal with the Orchid app is to give users insight and control over the network connection of their device. To gain privacy, users configure a circuit in Orchid by setting up an Orchid account and funding it with OXT. Then the Orchid app connects to the Orchid network and selects a node using Orchid\u2019s linear stake-weighted algorithm to serve as a VPN and pays for bandwidth via a continuous stream of tiny OXT nanopayments . In a single-hop circuit configuration, Orchid provides: Protection from websites seeing your real IP address and physical location Protection from your ISP seeing what websites you are visiting and when Access to the open Internet--once a user can connect to Orchid, they are not restricted by ISP level firewalls and can browse the entire Internet freely A potential problem with using only a single VPN provider is that the provider running the single node circuit knows both your IP address and the content you are accessing. If the provider maintains logs, those logs could be sold to advertisers or otherwise used against you. In the current VPN marketplace, it is hard to know who is maintaining logs and who is not. For Orchid nodes, we have developed a flexible curation system that gives users a way to pick whom to trust. Another solution is to trust no single provider with enough information to know both who you are and what information you are accessing. To that end, Orchid supports an advanced feature that allows users to configure multi-hop routes by stringing together multiple nodes into a flexible multi-hop circuit. Orchid currently supports several underlying protocols including the native Orchid VPN protocol and OpenVPN, allowing users to mix and match Orchid nodes with traditional VPN nodes. While the potential is there to protect the user from any one provider knowing enough information to reveal their circuit, this is an advanced feature that is currently \"use at your own risk\". How is Orchid private given that it has public payments on a blockchain? The Orchid app pays for the circuit by sending a continuous stream of tiny nanopayments to providers for the duration of the connection. While the nanopayment architecture locks user funds into a smart contract and--very rarely--winning tickets result in macro-payments posted on the blockchain where the account exists. When that happens, the user\u2019s address, the provider\u2019s address, and a timestamp are stored publically on the blockchain. Note that the payment address of the provider is not a mapping to any single server; instead it is an arbitrary (and potentially temporary) payment address that the provider created specifically to receive funds. Also, the frequency of how often on-chain payments occur is configurable by the user. All information gained by a potential network attacker is an advantage. However, consider exactly what information is revealed. For an Orchid user running a single hop circuit: the provider sees the user\u2019s payment address when it accepts service, along with the user\u2019s real IP address and the destination addresses that the user is connecting to (if it maintains logs). Once a rare on-chain payment is made, the user\u2019s payment address and provider\u2019s payment address are stored on the blockchain with a timestamp available to the public. When considering anonymity, it is important to understand if the user is linked to the crypto used in their circuit. Worst case, if the user purchased the crypto used to fund the account on an exchange with their real identity, or the VPN provider used in the circuit maintained logs, then either of those two entities could be compelled to give information that could deanonymize the user. Similarly, a user who paid for a traditional 0VPN service that maintained logs with a credit card could be deanonymized with just one entity being compelled. A multi-hop circuit affords greater network protections, but to setup a multi-hop Orchid circuit, it would be naive to pay for each hop from the same Ethereum wallet. In that configuration, each provider would be able to see that wallet\u2019s address and potentially use that address to get information about the user. To mitigate that, a better way to setup multi-hop circuits would be to use different wallet addresses for each Orchid hop. If every wallet address is independently dissociated from the user, the full circuit might be quite difficult to link back to the user. Again, multi-hop circuits in Orchid are an advanced feature; use at your own risk. Can Orchid nodes monitor network traffic? Yes, providers on Orchid could monitor the bytes that come in and out of the Orchid node. However, all traffic carried over Orchid between hops from the user to the exit is encrypted at the Orchid protocol level, which is an additional layer of encryption. The final exit traffic is then decrypted by the exit node and sent to the destination. In many cases the underlying traffic will also be encrypted with protocols such as TLS, providing at least two layers of encryption. However, not all traffic on the Internet is encrypted and Orchid doesn\u2019t fix that problem. The last hop configured in the active circuit will need to send the user requests out onto the Internet. So if the user sends an HTTP request, which has no SSL/TLS encryption, Orchid will honor that request and cleartext information would be revealed to the Orchid node. For this reason, you should always use SSL/TLS for sensitive Internet connections, even on Orchid. And even SSL/TLS encryption leaves metadata that the Orchid node could monitor, including the destination address, hostname, packet sizes and the timing of packets. Using Orchid\u2019s multi-hop feature with a three hop circuit would compartmentalize the information any one provider could monitor. With a properly configured multi-hop circuit the origin and destination of the traffic would be anonymized from any one provider, however, that is an advanced feature which is currently \"use at your own risk\". The way the different Orchid hops are funded has an impact on information leakage that could potentially de-anonymize. Lastly, the Orchid client randomly selects from a \"curated list\" of providers. This adds an additional layer of protection as users could pick or make their own curated list of providers that they trust or someone that they trust, trusts. Orchid has a default list of trusted providers that ships with the Orchid app. So I'm totally private and anonymous when I use a VPN like Orchid? No. Orchid is a tool that keeps private certain types of information from ISPs, websites, and providers. Orchid adds layers that separate you from the content you are trying to access. If you login to Amazon, the website will know that it is you and can build out information about what you are doing on their website, even with Orchid enabled. However, your local ISP or network provider will not know you are visiting Amazon. Amazon will not know where you are in the world, and will not get your real IP address. If using at least three hops, no single provider will know your IP address and know that you are accessing Amazon. Also consider that Orchid is a VPN and that all VPNs have vulnerabilities at the software level. Typical modern browsers that are not \"hardened\" run all sorts of \u201cactive content\u201d such as Java, Javascript, Adobe Flash, Adobe Shockwave, QuickTime, RealAudio, ActiveX controls, and VBScript and other binary applications. This code runs at the operating system level with user account access, meaning they can access anything your user account can access. These technologies could store cookies, bypass proxy settings, store other types of data and share information directly to other sites on the Internet. Therefore, these technologies must be disabled in the browser you are using to improve your security in conjunction with using Orchid. Other metadata such as the size of the browser window, type of pointing device used and other unique information could be used to \"fingerprint\" the user and potentially de-anonymize. These browser fingerprinting attacks could affect any VPN users, Orchid included. Hardened browsers can help reduce or eliminate the user\u2019s visible browser fingerprint. Also certain apps or code running on your device could send de-anonymizing data out to the Internet or third parties. No VPN can prevent attacks from arbitrary software running on your device, such as malware or a virus. Furthermore, there is active network security research into \"traffic fingerprinting\" attacks that attempt to reveal private information by monitoring encrypted connections. By watching the timing and size of packets, an adversary monitoring an encrypted connection could get a good idea if a particular user is watching a video, browsing the Internet or downloading a large file, just based on the timing and size of packets. Further analysis could reveal what websites are visited by seeing the sequence of things that are loaded\u2014 again, the timing and size of packets along with when requests are made. Orchid is researching \"bandwidth burning\" and related techniques to help obfuscate a user\u2019s traffic against these advanced packet timing and size analysis attacks. Technology How does the Orchid token (OXT) work? OXT is a \"pre-mined\" cryptocurrency based on the ERC-20 standard that will be used to decentralize trust between buyers and sellers in the Orchid marketplace. It also functions as a tool to promote security and healthy market dynamics, as providers can adjust their OXT stake to remain competitive. Read more about OXT here . How do curated lists work on Orchid? The Orchid client calls an on-chain \u2018curated list\u2019 smart contract which filters the viable nodes on Orchid (that is, nodes that have properly staked) into a custom subset. Initial releases of the official Orchid client will use this feature to prevent certain kinds of attacks from malicious exit nodes (e.g. SSL downgrade attacks) by using a default list consisting of trusted VPN partners. Overall, the curated lists are a federated reputation solution for determining what VPN providers on Orchid you can trust. The system is fully programmable, exists on-chain and is Turing complete. The list function can take information as an argument, and then use that information to determine, for any given Orchid node, whether you want to connect to that node or not. The official Orchid client has a default list and can select from different lists. Eventually we expect well known third parties to emerge as curators. Given that this system is on-chain, an entity such as a DAO could manage a list too. The curated list mechanism is a means for the importation of external reputational trust to supplement the economic incentive based trust provided by node staking. What is the Orchid Protocol? The Orchid software is designed to use a custom VPN protocol, similar in scope to OpenVPN or WireGuard. The Orchid protocol is designed for high-performance networking and runs on top of WebRTC, a common web standard, widely used to transmit video and audio from inside browsers. Our protocol is intended to allow users to request access to remote network resources and pay for these resources using OXT via a nanopayments system. Staking What is Staking in Orchid? Staking is a process where one deposits and locks up an asset into an illiquid contract or mechanism in exchange for revenue or rewards. Orchid providers stake OXT tokens in an Ethereum smart contract (the directory) to advertize their services to clients. Orchid clients then select providers randomly, weighted by proportional stake, so that the probability of picking a particular provider is equal to their fraction of the total stake. Anyone else can also stake on a provider\u2019s address, allowing a form of \"delegated staking\". Any OXT holder can stake their OXT tokens on providers of their choosing. There are no automatic benefits of staking on someone else\u2019s behalf, but the staking mechanism could be combined with a revenue sharing contract between the staker and the stakee. Is Orchid Staking like Proof of Stake? Staking in Orchid is similar to proof of stake systems only in the sense of using stake as a linear weighting mechanism. In most proof-of-stake systems stakeholders can automatically earn revenue just by running nodes with stake. Orchid has no such automatic mechanism, and has no inflation to fund staking. The only source of income on Orchid is customers paying for bandwidth. How can I earn passive revenue on my OXT? You can find an Orchid bandwidth provider who is seeking staking partners in exchange for a share of revenue or recurring payments - using any on-chain or off-chain mechanism. An Ethereum smart contract can be used to help automatically split revenue between a staker and a provider. The staker would stake on the smart contract, and the provider would direct client payments to the smart contract, which would then allow each party to withdraw some parameterized fraction of the funds. Note that any such delegated staking arrangement (even using on-chain mechanisms) can not guarantee that the provider will actually honor the contract: the provider could easily direct clients to a different payment address. And even if the provider is perfectly honest, there is still ultimately uncertainty in revenue and consequent return on stake. As an alternative to revenue sharing, providers could send recurring payments to the staker - essentially a stake rental or leasing arrangement. In this case the return is more predictable, but there is still no guarantee that the provider will make the scheduled payments. Again a smart contract could be used to help automate the payments, but can not guarantee the provider will have the necessary funds. There is always risk. When a staker decides to repoint their stake to a different provider, there is a lengthy withdrawal delay (currently about 3 months). So it is important for stakers to choose providers carefully. Stakers should start with small allocations and slowly increase them based on measured profitability. Eventually third party websites could provide an interface to help simplify and automate the process of finding, evaluating and staking on Orchid bandwidth providers.","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"faq/#orchid-faq","text":"","title":"Orchid FAQ"},{"location":"faq/#security-and-privacy","text":"","title":"Security and Privacy"},{"location":"faq/#what-protections-does-the-orchid-app-provide","text":"Basic Internet connections function by transmitting packets of data between two hosts (computers). In order to find their way, packets contain both a source and destination IP address. As packets move from the destination to the source, different routers and physical infrastructure require both of these addresses for the two-way connection to be established and maintained. This means that instantly and over time, the owners of the physical infrastructure are in a position to build a profile of Internet usage on their paying user (you!) and also to block content as the owner sees fit. Typically these infrastructure owners are ISPs \u2014 mobile carriers providing phone data connections, home cable Internet providers, WiFi hotspot operators, and any Internet backbone operators that have peering agreements with user-facing ISPs. In all these cases, the ISP is in an advantaged position to monitor and/or restrict Internet usage. It is common in many countries for ISPs to restrict content so that users cannot load certain websites. If you are not happy with or do not trust your existing ISP(s), by using Orchid you can currently limit their knowledge to knowing only that you are sending and receiving bytes through Orchid, and completely block their ability to mess with the details of your traffic, unblocking the previously blocked content. They either block all of Orchid or nothing, so if things continue to work after turning on Orchid, then your ISP has allowed \"Orchid in general\" and cannot manipulate the individual bytes between you and the rest of the Internet, granting you access to the entire Internet.","title":"What protections does the Orchid app provide?"},{"location":"faq/#how-can-the-orchid-app-help-me-with-privacy-today","text":"The goal with the Orchid app is to give users insight and control over the network connection of their device.

At its core, the dApp is a wrapper for the function calls of the smart contract combined with UI elements to help users make decisions for their account makeup. Orchid Labs hosts the dApp at account.orchid.com DApp Overview The interface allows users to create and manage their Orchid account. Orchid is an EVM-compatible layer 2 that enables the transmission of tiny payments. Users connect their L1 wallet on one of the supported chains, and using the dApp, they can move funds into and out of their Orchid accounts. We currently support the following chains: Aurora Avalanche Binance CELO Ethereum Fantom Gnosis Optimism Polygon Once a wallet is connected, the interface will activate for the Orchid account associated with that wallet. The interface will show your account\u2019s balance, deposit, amount of available tickets, and the efficiency of your account\u2019s tickets. The \u201cAdd\u201d and \u201cWithdraw\u201d tabs at the bottom of the interface are where you can add funds or remove them from the selected account. Creating an Account To successfully create and fund an account, there are three important steps: connecting your wallet, adding an Orchid identity, and funding the account. Connecting a wallet In order to make the dApp active, you will need to attach a funder wallet. The \u201cConnect\u201d button will show your wallet options, depending on whether you are on desktop or mobile, and whether or not a wallet is detected. This step is similar to \u201clogging in\u201d, as the funder wallet you use to create the account is required to access and manage the account. The key supported wallet connection methods are: Load the dApp in a dApp browser Use a desktop browser with a web3 browser plugin enabled For testing purposes, Orchid uses Metamask. Once the wallet is connected, you will see the address of that wallet displayed as the \u201cfunder wallet\u201d with the funds associated with it appearing next to the address. L2 keys/Orchid identity As Orchid is a layer 2 solution, you will need to generate an Orchid identity in addition to your wallet to fund your account. Keys are created and managed in the Orchid app; to fund your Orchid account, simply copy the Orchid identity from your Orchid app into the Orchid dApp. Determining balance/deposit size The backbone of Orchid is a probabilistic payment system designed to mitigate the amount of transactions and subsequent gas fees for the end user. Essentially, Orchid conducts transactions with a lottery ticket system. Let\u2019s say you wanted to pay your provider $100 incrementally; instead of paying them $1 one hundred times and paying 100 transaction fees, with Orchid, you send them 100 lottery tickets, with each ticket having a 1% chance of winning $100. The provider receives the same amount of money, but instead of paying for 100 transactions, you only pay for the one winning ticket. When funding your account, the value of your tickets is set to half the value of your deposit. However, Orchid\u2019s services will not withdraw funds from your deposit; to generate tickets for your account, you must add funds to your balance, which Orchid will draw from whenever a winning ticket is pulled by your provider. Now, a core component of determining the size of your balance and deposit is \u201cefficiency\u201d. When it comes to Orchid lottery tickets, since the user still has to pay an L1 network fee for that winning transaction to go on-chain, we use the concept of \u201cefficiency\u201d to denote the transmitted value as a percentage of the total ticket value to the provider. So, if you gave your provider a winning ticket worth $100, but your ticket\u2019s efficiency is only 20%, the provider will receive the $100 and pay $80 in L1 network fees, meaning they only really receive $20. The amount of tickets you hold on your account is also an important factor, to combat the variance of the probabilistic system. To read more about variance, click here . For funding your account, we recommend maintaining a deposit large enough for at least 90% efficiency, and a balance large enough for at least four tickets. For your convenience, Orchid provides users with a chart showing each of our partnered chains and the recommended amounts (in USD) to fund an account\u2019s balance, deposit, and the fees associated with funding and withdrawing from your account. You can view the chart here . Because efficiency is coupled tightly with network transaction fees, it is useful to see if there is something abnormal happening with current gas fees that could cause the efficiencies of Orchid accounts to rapidly change. If network fees rise on a given L1 where an Orchid account is housed, a larger deposit will be required to maintain the same level of efficiency. Funding the account Enter the amount of balance and deposit you want to add into the corresponding fields, denominated in token values from your wallet\u2019s chain of choice. We currently support nine chains: Aurora, Avalanche, Binance, CELO, Ethereum, Fantom, Gnosis, Optimism and Polygon. Once again, you can consult our chart to determine the amount necessary to fund your account to our recommended values of 90% efficiency and four tickets. You can click on \u201cUSD Prices\u201d in the top-right to view our recommended values in USD to better understand the amount being added. Once you\u2019ve entered your desired funds, tap on the Add Funds button to submit the transaction to your attached wallet for approval; once approved, the transaction will be submitted to the blockchain and confirmed. A transaction pop-up will link to that blockchain\u2019s block explorer so you can view the confirmation. Add funds tab The \u201cAdd Funds\u201d tab allows you to add either to the deposit or balance of your account. In order to add funds to an account, the funder wallet of the account will need to be connected to the dApp interface. Once there is enough currency in the funder wallet, click the \u201cAdd Funds\u201d button to initiate the transaction. The funder wallet needs to approve the transaction, then a purple banner will appear with the status of your transaction. Withdraw tab The \u201cWithdraw\u201d tab allows you to pull funds from the balance and deposit of the account to a wallet of your choice. If the deposit is still locked, only the balance will be able to be withdrawn. If you are looking to withdraw everything from the account, the way to do this with the least amount of network fees is to unlock the deposit, then withdraw the balance and deposit together. That way, you only incur network fees for the unlock and withdraw, as opposed to incurring fees for the withdrawal twice. Unlocking funds The deposit of all Orchid accounts requires a 24 hour cool-off period before it can be withdrawn. The cool-off period gives enough time for providers to settle any winning tickets they may have, and prevents double spending on the network. When funds are added to a deposit, they are considered \u201clocked\u201d; these locked funds are used by the network for calculations. Once a deposit is unlocked, those deposit funds are not counted towards the usable deposit on the network. To unlock and withdraw funds, go to the Withdraw tab, check the \u201cUnlock deposit\u201d checkbox, then click \u201cUnlock Deposit\u201d at the bottom to send the transaction for approval in your wallet. Once that transaction is confirmed, the deposit funds will be available in 24 hours. Advanced tab The Advanced tab allows you to access all the features of the dApp from a single tab. To add or withdraw funds from your deposit/balance, enter the desired amount of funds in the token used to fund the account, select \u201cAdd\u201d or \u201cWithdraw\u201d from the dropdown menu, and click \u201cSubmit Transaction\u201d. If you want to withdraw from your deposit, but don\u2019t want to unlock/withdraw the entire amount, you can use \u201cSet Warned Amount\u201d to unlock a portion of your deposit. Enter the amount you wish to unlock, and click \u201cSubmit Transaction\u201d. Note that moving funds from your deposit to your balance or withdrawing from your deposit will require you to unlock the funds in your deposit, which can be done using the \u201cwarn\u201d feature and requires a 24 hour cool-off period before being made available. Orchid DApp FAQs Why do I need a new Ethereum wallet? Why can\u2019t I use my main wallet? While you could use your primary Ethereum wallet, we do not recommend it if you are seeking privacy with Orchid. Using Orchid results in on-chain payments flowing from your wallet to the Orchid nanopayment contract, and then on to VPN providers selling bandwidth. Ethereum on-chain analytics can easily link payments to/from the nanopayment smart contract, and then to providers. If the source of the funds comes from your personal Ethereum wallet, anyone using Etherscan would be able to see that you used Orchid and sent payments to VPN providers whenever the Orchid nanopayment system issues a winning ticket. Why should I trust a big exchange with my personal info? Would a decentralized exchange that doesn\u2019t store my personal info be better? While a decentralized exchange does not store personal information that could link your source of funds to your identity, a decentralized exchange does typically require an Ethereum account with some sort of crypto such as ETH, which has its own history of transactions. If that ETH or wallet is linked to your identity, then the source of funds could be linked through the DEX back to your originating Ethereum wallet. A large exchange typically has a ledger they use to keep track of ownership, with a hot wallet they use to send funds in and out of the exchange. While the exchange knows your identity, the movement of currency in and out of the exchange is anonymous, as the funds can\u2019t be tracked to your identity on the blockchain without the exchange being hacked, subpoenaed or otherwise compromised. How do I switch accounts? To switch accounts in the DApp, you will need to do so within the connected wallet which is typically Metamask. To switch between wallet accounts in Metamask, you can click your wallet identicon on the top right and swap to a different wallet account. Otherwise, to disconnect your wallet, open the MetaMask add-on then below the fox icon on the top left, click where it says connected. Click the three dots on the right of the shown account to disconnect your wallet. You may need to refresh your browser before you\u2019re able to reconnect.","title":"The Orchid DApp"},{"location":"orchid-dapp/#the-orchid-dapp","text":"","title":"The Orchid DApp"},{"location":"orchid-dapp/#what-is-the-orchid-dapp","text":"The Orchid dApp is a hosted front-end for users to create and manage Orchid accounts, so users don\u2019t need to interact with the smart contract directly.

Essentially, Orchid conducts transactions with a lottery ticket system. Let\u2019s say you wanted to pay your provider $100 incrementally; instead of paying them $1 one hundred times and paying 100 transaction fees, with Orchid, you send them 100 lottery tickets, with each ticket having a 1% chance of winning $100. The provider receives the same amount of money, but instead of paying for 100 transactions, you only pay for the one winning ticket. When funding your account, the value of your tickets is set to half the value of your deposit. However, Orchid\u2019s services will not withdraw funds from your deposit; to generate tickets for your account, you must add funds to your balance, which Orchid will draw from whenever a winning ticket is pulled by your provider. Now, a core component of determining the size of your balance and deposit is \u201cefficiency\u201d. When it comes to Orchid lottery tickets, since the user still has to pay an L1 network fee for that winning transaction to go on-chain, we use the concept of \u201cefficiency\u201d to denote the transmitted value as a percentage of the total ticket value to the provider. So, if you gave your provider a winning ticket worth $100, but your ticket\u2019s efficiency is only 20%, the provider will receive the $100 and pay $80 in L1 network fees, meaning they only really receive $20. The amount of tickets you hold on your account is also an important factor, to combat the variance of the probabilistic system. To read more about variance, click here . For funding your account, we recommend maintaining a deposit large enough for at least 90% efficiency, and a balance large enough for at least four tickets. For your convenience, Orchid provides users with a chart showing each of our partnered chains and the recommended amounts (in USD) to fund an account\u2019s balance, deposit, and the fees associated with funding and withdrawing from your account. You can view the chart here . Because efficiency is coupled tightly with network transaction fees, it is useful to see if there is something abnormal happening with current gas fees that could cause the efficiencies of Orchid accounts to rapidly change. If network fees rise on a given L1 where an Orchid account is housed, a larger deposit will be required to maintain the same level of efficiency.","title":"Determining balance/deposit size"},{"location":"orchid-dapp/#funding-the-account","text":"Enter the amount of balance and deposit you want to add into the corresponding fields, denominated in token values from your wallet\u2019s chain of choice.

For product support, send an email to help@orchid.com . Quick Setup To get a single hop connection running ASAP, simply open the Orchid app, tap \"Get started for $1\", and confirm the $1 USD (or equivalent local currency) in-app purchase. Orchid will then fund your account on the xDAI blockchain with a 0.10 xDAI deposit and ~0.87 xDAI balance. The app will also construct a single hop circuit using the new account. After the purchase completes, hit the \u201cConnect\u201d button to start the VPN, and you will connect randomly to an Orchid provider. The provider is selected based on the amount of OXT that provider staked on the network; this is for security purposes and incentive alignment. It's that easy! Home The home screen displays key pieces of information about how your device is connecting to the Internet, your account balance(s), an estimate on how many GB of service you could use, and the current average price of bandwidth. Tapping \u201cManage Accounts\u201d will take you to the account manager. Tapping \u201c1 Hop Circuit\u201d will take you to the circuit builder. The average price per GB for VPN service is displayed by polling the Chainlink oracle, which averages the cost of bandwidth across the different providers in the network. Problems with your account balance, deposit or circuit will be denoted with a red \u2018!\u2019. Circuit and account display The active circuit and associated Orchid accounts that are paying for each hop are displayed in the middle of the home screen; this window will show the Orchid identity and balance of the active account. To change your active circuit, tap the \u201c1 Hop Circuit\u201d display to go into the circuit builder. Orchid identity The hexadecimal address displayed for each hop in the circuit display is the Orchid identity associated with that account. NOTE: An Orchid identity is NOT an Ethereum wallet, even though it appears like an Ethereum wallet. Never send cryptocurrency to your Orchid identity; doing so could cause loss of funds. An Orchid identity is your public address within the nanopayment system. When you first start the app, a new identity is created for you. You can easily create/delete/import/export identities in the account manager. You can add funds to an identity in the account manager on the xDAI chain using an in-app purchase or you can take the Orchid identity and add funds to it in the dApp. Connecting For the \u201cConnect\u201d button to become available, you will need a funded account and an active circuit. If the circuit widget displays \"0 Hop Circuit\", tap on it, go into the circuit builder, and select from a funded Orchid account, an OpenVPN configuration or a WireGuard configuration to establish your circuit. After tapping \u201cConnect\u201d, Orchid will: Display \"Orchid connecting\u201d Pause all Internet traffic on the device Call the default Ethereum RPC to access the stake-weighted random selection smart contract Check to ensure that provider is in the curator Connect to the provider Change the status to \u201cConnected\u201d and animate the logo Note that this process can sometimes take a few dozen seconds, depending on the status of Orchid\u2019s providers. If the process is stuck, it could be because the Orchid providers are rejecting your Orchid account or because your device is having trouble connecting to the default Ethereum RPC endpoint, and so cannot get information about the state of the provider directory. It is also possible to connect to a server, have the screen change states, and then have the connection die. Typically turning the app off/on can help kickstart the reconnect process whenever you experience no connectivity. Account manager The account manager allows you to manage multiple accounts and associated identities. It is also where you can go to export and import accounts. The identity is displayed under \"Orchid Identity\". The funder wallet address is displayed inside the account. The identity and funder wallet together are key bits of information for each account. Learn more about Orchid's layer 2 nanopayment system: Orchid accounts . Add funds with an in-app purchase Orchid includes a system for buying \"prepaid access credits\" to connect to our list of preferred providers . Orchid VPN providers that are not part of the preferred provider system cannot accept payments in prepaid access credits, which limits the number of providers available to you when using prepaid access credits. Also Orchid manages the funder wallet for the account. Therefore, the crypto purchased via in-app payments is custodial, and not available for withdrawal or transfer by the user. The add funds option is available on iOS/macOS and Android. You will need a valid form of payment attached to your Apple or Google account associated with the phone to make the in-app purchase. The fiat amount of the in-app payment will be denominated in your local currency. The purchase will convert the amount to xDAI and fund the selected identity on the xDai blockchain, a stable payments blockchain designed for fast and inexpensive transactions. Orchid accounts created on xDAI are viewable using the BlockScout Explorer . Learn more about xDai . When using the \"Get Started for $1\" quick start, you will fund the account for $1. From the account manager, you can add funds in three different preset amounts: $1, $5 and $20. This function is more appropriate for topping up an account when funds run low. Note that there is no significant advantage in terms of pricing for purchasing a larger account;~~.~~ Orchid is simply converting your fiat to the xDAI stablecoin and placing those funds on-chain in your selected account. The average price per GB across the network is denoted on the homescreen and varies from provider to provider. Add funds with the dApp To fund an account yourself you will need a wallet (we primarily test with Metamask's Chrome plug-in ) and the appropriate funds for the blockchain that you want to house the account. You will also need enough crypto to pay for the gas fees associated with executing the nanopayment contract. Note: Do not transfer funds to your Orchid identity! That will not work. You will need to use the Orchid dApp in order to manage your on-chain funds yourself. All transactions using the dApp, including funding the account, unlocking your deposit, and withdrawing funds from the account, will require the user to pay for network fees on the blockchain that houses the account. Before you can use the Orchid dApp, you will also need an Orchid identity that you intend to fund. From the account manager, you can tap on the hexadecimal string under Orchid Identity to copy the identity to your clipboard. Paste this information into the Identity field in the dApp to manage that account. Learn more about how to create an account in the Orchid dApp. Sharing accounts In previous iterations of Orchid, it was possible to share accounts by simply importing an identity, then the blockchain was automatically scanned to find the funder address associated with that identity.. As a result of opening our platform to partnerships with multiple chains \u2013 many that do not support scanning for Orchid accounts \u2013 users are required to specify the funder wallet and chain used to fund the account. To share an account, you need to determine the L1 funder wallet address, import an L2 Orchid identity key, and select the chain the account was funded on. Importing accounts To import an account, go to Manage Accounts, tap on the cog in the top-right, and select \u201cImport Account\u201d. From there, you can either select the identity you want to import from the dropdown menu, or select \u201cImport Identity\u201d to scan a new identity. Once you import the identity, you will enter the L1 funder address in the next menu, and then select the chain the account was funded on. Then you press \u201cImport Account\u201d, and your Orchid account will be available to use in the app. Exporting identities To export your selected Orchid identity, go to \u201cManage Accounts\u201d, tap on the cog wheel in the upper right, and select \u201cExport Identity\u201d to bring up the identity export interface. You will then get a scannable QR code of the key and a Copy button that will copy the key into your clipboard. With the key, the funds in the Orchid account can be spent or extracted. It is a good practice to save the key in your password manager or to store it somewhere safe. The best practice for storing all the relevant details of an Orchid account is to save the funding wallet as a username and the raw key as the password in a password manager. Circuit builder Orchid provides the only multi-hop VPN application that allows you to make an \"onion route\" through multiple independent VPN servers with layered encryption between each node. This screen allows you to manage the VPN server connections that form your circuit. A single hop circuit is similar to a typical VPN provider. Three hops is a standard \"onion route\". For more information about the implications of multiple hops, refer to the FAQ section on Security . To add a hop to your circuit, enter the Circuit Builder menu by either selecting \u201cCircuit Builder\u201d in the menu or tapping on the \u201c0 Hop Circuit\u201d button on the main page. Here, you can view your current hop configuration and add hops. Swiping left or right on a hop will delete it, and long pressing on a hop will allow you to change its position in the circuit; the entry node is at the top of the screen and the exit node is at the bottom. While Orchid accounts are stored in the account manager, there is no way to store OpenVPN or WireGuard hops, except by adding them to your active circuit. See below on how to save your circuit and export the entire configuration, which could help you manage inactive OpenVPN or WireGuard hops. Orchid hop Orchid hops are not a single specific server, but are rather defined as an Orchid account that will pay for a randomized node picked from the stake-weighted random directory. When you connect, the app runs through the directory and gets back a server to use in the circuit; this randomness is an important part of Orchid. For detailed information on stake-weighted random selection and why it matters, read section 4.4 of the Orchid whitepaper . To add an Orchid node, you will need to first select the identity of the payment account,then select the funding wallet. The Orchid identity and funding wallet are two key pieces of information that define an Orchid account. The app scans blockchains using RPC servers for active accounts. If account detection fails, it is possible to paste in the funding wallet. Many of the multiple blockchains where you can house Orchid accounts do not support chain scanning, so you will need to manually paste in the funder wallet address. WireGuard Orchid supports WireGuard. When you add a WireGuard server to your circuit, Orchid will connect to that specific WireGuard server. First, you will need access to your WireGuard configuration file. Each protocol will have its own method of accessing your configuration files; we have provided the steps for a few WireGuard protocols. Surfshark: Go to your Surfshark account . In the sidebar, navigate to the VPN section, select \u201cManual setup\u201d from the dropdown menu, then choose the WireGuard protocol. If this is your first time creating your WireGuard hop, select \u201cI don\u2019t have a key pair\u201d to generate your private and public keys. Once you\u2019ve chosen your preferred server location, download the configuration file, then open it in a text editor. You will need this information in the next step to set up your hop on the Orchid app. Mullvad: Find your Mullvad VPN account . In the account settings, navigate to the section titled WireGuard configuration under the \u201cDownloads\u201d section. Choose your desired platform, generate a key, and select a server from their list of available countries. Once you\u2019ve completed the required fields, download the configuration file, then open it in a text editor. You will need this information in the next step to set up your hop on the Orchid app. Proton: Register for ProtonVPN . Once you\u2019ve created your account, navigate to the \u201cDownloads\u201d section. Note there are different server listings for OpenVPN and WireGuard; you\u2019ll want to navigate to the WireGuard servers. Select the platform you\u2019ll be using (iOS, Android, MacOS, Windows, etc.), and find a server you wish to connect to. From there, click \u201cCreate\u201d, which will generate a configuration file for that server. Once you've found your configuration file, go to the Orchid app, and navigate to the Circuit Builder, either through the \u201cHop Circuit\u201d button on the main menu, or through \u201cCircuit Builder\u201d on the sidebar menu. Select \u201cAdd New Hop\u201d, and choose \u201cEnter WireGuard Config\u201d. Paste the entire body of your WireGuard config file into the text box, then press \u201cSave\u201d. OpenVPN Orchid supports OpenVPN. Go to the Circuit Builder, tap \u201cAdd a Hop\u201d, and then put in the information for that OpenVPN server. OpenVPN configuration files can vary from VPN provider to VPN provider. We don't know if all configurations work; please email us at help@orchid.com for support, or to let us know what is working/not working for you. We appreciate your help! Here are some items to note and check: Orchid uses OpenVPN3 without command line flags user/password is provided when adding the config. If your config contains auth-user-pass then try adding client-cert-not-required on a newline try removing arguments to auth-user-pass Saving your circuit For Orchid hops, the app stores Orchid account information from the account manager. Deleting an Orchid hop doesn't destroy any information. For WireGuard and OpenVPN, there is no way to save each specific hop at this time. If you delete either type of hop, the config information that you entered will be deleted. One mechanism to save this information is to export your entire circuit configuration. Go to Settings, select \u201cConfiguration Management\u201d, and tap the Export button. You can save this configuration as text, or generate a QR code to import your configuration to another client with the Import button. Traffic analyzer Orchid has a built-in traffic monitor that can run with or without an Orchid account (it's a free feature!). Using the traffic monitor is similar to WireShark--and Orchid works on iOS! The traffic monitor also works across every platform that Orchid supports: iOS, macOS and Android. To enable the traffic analyzer and review your device\u2019s connections, tap on the traffic light icon in the upper right of the homescreen, or select \u201cTraffic Analysis\u201d from the menu. Traffic filters The traffic analyzer supports different ways to filter the traffic to better make sense of the connections your phone is making: Enter a hostname or partial hostname into the search bar to show only matching rows. Enter multiple terms separated by a space to combine hostname filters using \u201cAND\u201d logic, e.g. \u201cgoog api\u201d will match rows including both \u201cgoog\u201d and \u201capi\u201d, such as \u201capi1.google.com\u201d. Use a \u201c-\u201d minus sign to exclude terms, e.g. \u201c-goog\u201d will show all hostnames except those matching \u201cgoog\u201d. You can mix these to include and exclude combinations such as: \u201cgoogle -api\u201d to find all \u201cgoogle\u201d entries excluding those with \u201capi\u201d. Use \u201cprot:\u201d to filter by protocol name, e.g. \u201cprot:imap\u201d will match all traffic identified as \u201cimap\u201d connections and \u201c-prot:dns\u201d will filter out all DNS queries from the results. Settings From the homescreen, swipe right or tap the menu button in the top left. From there, you can navigate to all the screens in the app, get in-app help, and read the privacy policy, open source license and version number on the bottom. Default curator Orchid uses an on-chain curated list which filters the viable nodes to a custom subset called a curator. Orchid's official curator is partners.orch1d.eth . The Orchid client uses this list to prevent certain kinds of attacks from malicious exit nodes (e.g. SSL downgrade attacks) by using a default list with trusted VPN partners. The curator is set for each Orchid hop. This setting is the default that will appear whenyou add a hop. By leaving this blank, you will remove curation and accept a connection to any provider you connect to within the directory. The curation system is open, and it is possible for anyone to make a curated list. Query balances Orchid uses access to RPC endpoints to get information about account balances. If you do not want Orchid to connect to RPC endpoints for security reasons, turn off query balances in the Settings menu Advanced configuration The advanced configuration box is where you can input custom commands into the client. Mainly this is used for testing purposes; however, there are some user facing commands that are useful. Chain Settings The Chain Settings tab is where you can review connections to our partnered chains\u2019 RPC endpoints. The Ethereum Endpoint is the first and most important. For Orchid to connect, the app needs to access the Ethereum blockchain to access the stake weighted directory in order to find a provider. The default RPC uses Alchemy . If you hit the TEST button and it fails, you will need to find a working RPC endpoint to get a VPN connection. You can override the default Ethereum RPC by pasting the endpoint into the provided box. Some options to consider if Alchemy is failing: Cloudflare runs a public endpoint. Simply paste in https://cloudflare-eth.com and hit test to see if that works. You can run your own Ethereum node using GETH Infura offers free Ethereum endpoints after you register for an account POKT Network offers a free Ethereum endpoint after you register for an account Note that both POKT and Infura will require an account; after you register, they will provide a unique URL that you can paste in. Other Endpoints: If you have an account on a particular blockchain, the RPC server must be available in order for the app to be able to read your balance. Find the chain where your account is located and then test the chain to make sure the RPC endpoint is working. If not, find a new RPC endpoint for that chain and paste it into the box. Configuration management The Configuration Management screen is a way to export and import all of the accounts currently on the app along with the current active circuit. This is very useful for backing up all your accounts and current application state. Note: the keys to your Orchid account(s) will be exposed when you export your configuration. Use caution when exporting and do not store your keys in plaintext. Active circuit : the active circuit contains all the information sent to the backend vpn tunnel to form the multi-hop route. For OpenVPN and WireGuard hops, the account information and details to connect to that VPN node is encoded. For each Orchid hop, there is a curator, the public address of the funding wallet, the Orchid account private key, chainid of where the account is housed, the currency and the RPC endpoint for accessing information on the blockchain where hops = [{protocol: \"orch1d\", curator: \"partners.orch1d.eth\", funder: \"<public address of funder wallet>\", secret: \"<Orchid account key>\", chainid: 100, currency: \"DAI\", rpc=\"https://rpc.xdaichain.com/\"}]; To clarify the key terms and definitions: protocol : the VPN tunnel protocol. Either \"orch1d\" for Orchid, \"openvpn\" for OpenVPN or \"wireguard\" for WireGuard curator : for Orchid hops, this is the curator for this hop funder : the public address of the Ethereum wallet that created the account using the dApp; for xDAI accounts associated with the pre-paid access credit system, this address will be the custody wallet run by Orchid secret : the key of the Orchid account; accessible by going to Account Manager, tapping on the cog in the top-right, and selecting \u201cExport Identity\u201d chainid : the chainid of where the account is stored currency : the currency of the account balance and deposit rpc : the RPC endpoint used to look up account information on that chain Windows Beta Note: this is an early beta release that requires some effort on the command line in addition to manually editing files and installing a driver.

For xDAI accounts, some modifications are necessary. Paste your circuit from the configuration manager into a text editor. Note the chain used to fund the account.. Enter a newline and add in the Ethereum RPC with rpc = \"https://ethereum.publicnode.com\"; The final format should look like this for OXT accounts on Ethereum: Note: funder starts with 0x and secret does not hops = [{curator: \"partners.orch1d.eth\", protocol: \"orchid\", funder: \"0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000\", secret: \"00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\"}]; rpc = \"https://ethereum.publicnode.com\"; To use accounts on other blockchains, there is an extra step. You will need to add an RPC endpoint for that blockchain for each hop. For example, for a common XDAI account, you would add , rpc=\"https://rpc.xdaichain.com/ after the currency variable for each hop denoted in {} . The final format should look like this: hops = [{protocol: \"orch1d\", curator: \"partners.orch1d.eth\", funder: \"0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000\", secret: \"00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\", chainid: 100, currency: \"DAI\", rpc=\"https://rpc.xdaichain.com/\"}]; rpc = \"https://ethereum.publicnode.com\"; Save the file as 'orchid.cfg' In Notepad, you will need to make sure .txt is not appended. To do that, when you hit Save, select the \u201cSave as type\u201d dialog box and select \u201cAll Files.\u201d This will allow you to save the file with the .cfg file extension.

These logs provide advanced details about what the Orchid client is doing behind the scenes to provide you with a private browsing experience. This page is designed to help you collect and share the logs. Android Prerequisites Start by turning on developer and debugging mode on the phone by going to Settings -> About Phone -> About Software and tapping on the build number repeatedly until it prompts you to enable developer mode. Then go to Settings -> Developer Settings -> Turn on USB Debugging . Android and iOS Prerequisites When you connect your device to your computer, it will prompt you to trust the computer. It is important that you do so. Otherwise, you will be unable to collect logs. Cydia Impactor The easiest way to gather logs from both iOS and Android devices is through Cydia Impactor . In the main window, use the \"Select\" menu to choose the correct device (if you only have one mobile device connected to your computer, this will be done for you). Next, go to Device -> Watch Log... . A terminal window will appear, showing a streaming syslog from your mobile device. adb logcat (Android) If you are using an Android device, you can alternatively collect logs through the Android Debug Bridge (ADB). You can follow this guide to install adb on Windows, macOS, or Linux; once installed, you can run the following command in a terminal to view the logs: adb logcat Sanitizing the Logs The logs you gather will contain information from all applications and actions taken on your device during the period that logs are being gathered. These are not all necessary for debugging purposes. You can optionally filter out all lines that do not contain the string orchid as a quick way to sanitize the output. You can do this with a command like: grep -i 'orchid' client.log Where client.log is the file containing the syslog output from the device. You should also be careful to filter out your various secret keys from the logs: grep -vi 'secret' client.log Sharing the Logs The logs you gather will be quite long; you almost certainly do not want to paste them in their entirety into something like a Telegram message. Instead, we encourage you to either share them as an attachment via your preferred method of communication. If you are using a communication platform that doesn't support attachments, you can utilize a private pastebin service such as GitHub Gists , which will provide you with a secret URL you can share to grant access to your logs. Orchid App troubleshooting/FAQs Help, my Internet connection shut off after I turned Orchid on Orchid has a built-in \u201ckill switch\u201d, so turning Orchid on will sever all existing connections to the Internet and force them to go through Orchid. If Orchid is trying to connect, the Internet will be shut off until a connection is established. This is a feature that ensures that none of your Internet traffic will accidentally leak due to a disconnect/reconnect without you pressing the button first, and when you hit \u201cConnect\u201d, your traffic is only going through Orchid. Read Connecting for more information on exactly what happens when you hit \u201cConnect\u201d. I can\u2019t find my QR code after creating an account in the dApp When the QR code or text of an account is truly lost, the account is lost as well. If the account was ever added to the Orchid app, the account should appear under the cog wheel next to your Orchid Address. The funds are NOT LOST! To recover the funds from a lost account, you will need to withdraw the funds from that Orchid account using the dApp and the funder wallet used to create the account. Low balance/deposit/efficiency warning Under certain market conditions, users need to increase the size of their deposit. The market conditions are primarily driven by the price of the currency and the amount of network fees required for the provider to claim a ticket.

For xDAI accounts, some modifications are necessary. Paste your circuit from the configuration manager into a text editor. Note the chain used to fund the account..
